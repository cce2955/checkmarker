# checkmarker
Chrome Extension that checkmarks all elements on a webpage and replaces text in text boxes. There seems to be some webpages that block it, not entirely sure I'll look into that later but for most webpages this just works.

Download [the zip](https://github.com/cce2955/checkmarker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) on the repo page, extract somewhere, open up your extension page on a chrome based browser, set to developer mode, "load unpacked", select and add the folder you unzipped and go about your business
